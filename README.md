### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Pringos/Pringos** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:


--HI I am Nkosana Mbobo I am innovate, natural, creative and I have been working on creating a Cryptocurrency Coin called People's Coin. 
The reason creating such a coin was that due to the low rate of unemployment in South Africa is drastically lowered. People don't need to work for companies to earn a living the communities need their help to work at. 
The coin is based on funding projects in the communities using People's Coin Dapp(DECENTRALIZED APPLICATION) to broadcast donations, investors, air drops, rewards and also community services. 


People's Coin
This will be the most likely place where all of this projects will take place. The community will fund each project by issuing coins as form of investment at any project which takes place in the community. A rating of the project will take place at the Decentralized app which people who own the coins and also the market will invest. The aim of this coin is to give people job opportunities that will be able to help build their communities. Communities are not only important but it's also plays a role in the up bringing of opportunities and for the youth people who have learned about these uses cases to work and grow. 
The people's coin will develop their own application so that people can .
The projects will include home renovations, community gardening, community services, traffic management, roads development, community mining events, community bank, community security services, community, community support. The people who are mostly looking for jobs in communities will be employed to fix their community issues and problems. 
The rand VS major cryptocurrency 
The people's coin will be 50% pegged to the rand and 50% will be pegged to the major cryptocurrency this gives events surrounding the coin will be the fall and high of the coin. The coin will be priced at 5 cents which it be the first stable coin and can be used to pay, save, donate, invest and buy by the communty.
